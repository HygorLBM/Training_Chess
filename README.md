# Training_Chess
This is a university project where you should implement tree architecture to build an AI.
In this project the user is placed into a pre-established chess situation where he can checkmate in 3 turns.
Each turn moves the decision tree for the next level while the IA tries to escape your offensive or start one against you.
Is possible to win, to lose by being checkmated, or to lose by failing to checkmate in 3 turns.

This application is just a old assignment given to teach students how to use tree structures.
While the interface and implementation is not optimal by any means, I still
decided to post here since it is a simple sample of how to use trees for decision making.

This application is a Windows Form, built using Microsoft Visual Studios IDE.
